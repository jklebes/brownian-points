# brownian-points
To practice your cell tracking algorithms on.

Creates data in the style of ROI tables describing cells.

Simple: just brownian motion.  The number of cells is constant, except where they wander out of/into the image.

Hard: Cells split, merge, are lost to tracking for one frame, and dissapear.
