# brownian-points
To practice your cell tracking algorithms on.

Creates data in the style of ROI tables describing cells / blob objects.

Simple: just brownian motion.  The number of cells is constant, except where they wander out of/into the image.

Hard: Brownian motion, + cells split, appear, dissapear, or are skipped for one frame.
